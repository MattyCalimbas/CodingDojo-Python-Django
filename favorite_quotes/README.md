# Favorite Quotes (Coding Dojo Python/Django Project)

This a Coding Dojo project where under a 5 hour time constraint I created a fully functional web application that allows user login/registration to a dashboard page of quotes.  This web application has the ability for the user to submit and track their favorite quote(s) and also sports appropriate validations for all forms used.
